      <h2 id="first">Developers are in Demand</h2>
      <p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the number of software development jobs is predicted to grow at a rate of 17% between now and 2024.  <em><b>By 2020, an estimated 1 million computer programming jobs will go unfilled.</b></em>  This makes perfect sense, right?  Think about it.  Software has already made its way into virtually every corner of our lives; whether it’s this web site, your banking, shopping, music, movies, cars, appliances, and on and on.  This is only going to grow at an accelerated rate as the fields of automation, AI, and robotics continue to evolve.</p>
      <p>Virtually anyone with reasonable intelligence, a decent education and good personality with no experience can get an entry to mid-level "business" job based purely on potential.  The same cannot be said of programming.  Programming is a very specialized skill set that requires time, intelligence, patience, and focused training to learn.  Many people will decide that this path is not for them when the going gets tough.  Therefore, if you’re able to persevere, you will become a member of a fairly exclusive club.</p>

    <h2>Earning Potential</h2>
    <p>According to the BLS, median pay for application developers in the U.S. is $100,080.  I broke that down a bit further, for different levels of experience in my geographic area of Raleigh, NC.  I calculated blended averages for salaries from multiple sources including <a href="http://www.payscale.com">Payscale.com</a>, <a href="http://www.glassdoors.com">Glassdoors.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.salary.com">Salary.com</a>.</p>

    <p>The chart above looks at the minimum, average, and maximum salaries for software application developers in the Raleigh area broken out by years of experience.  The years of experience is roughly the track that I was predicting for myself to achieve what might more commonly be identified as junior, mid-level, senior, and management developers.  Even the entry-level salaries are quite good and it’s entirely feasible to achieve a six-figure salary within a few years.  The salaries in Raleigh are on the low side compared to the bigger markets, but are probably about average when looking across the country as a whole.  Your mileage may vary.</p>

    <h2>Training Options</h2>
    <p>There are a plethora of options available to get the training required.  It’s no longer necessary to get a 4-year Computer Science (CS) degree to get a great job.  Various forms of “coding bootcamps” have popped up around the world.  These can be completed in anywhere from 12 weeks to 2 years.  They can be done in an intensive full-time fashion or entirely at your own pace.  In a classroom or online.  The choice is yours.  Costs can vary greatly from free to nearly $20,000.  There are many resources available to help you find the right program for you.  A quick Google search on “coding bootcamps” will yield plenty of local and online options to begin investigating.  The challenge is not finding one, but rather finding the right one for you.</p>
